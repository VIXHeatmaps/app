Heatmap values are based on H. 

H is the Calmar ratio except: 
(1) H subtracts AR Min from AR (reducing the H score for signals with low AR)
(2) H increases low MD to the MD Min (reducing the H score for signals with low MD)

Heatmap cells with values above AR Max look darker. 

AR Min, MD Min, and MD Max are adjusted with the sliders.
