Heatmap values are based on H. 

H is the Calmar ratio except: 
(1) H subtracts AR Min from AR (reducing the H score for signals with low AR)
(2) H increases all MD to the MD Min (reducing the H score for signals with low MD)

The AR Max applies a dark wash to identify signals above the AR Max number.
